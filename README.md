For Halloween of 2022, my girlfriend Lindsey wants to do a Strangers Thing theme for our decorations. 
I thought it would be fun to try and recreate the wall with the letters in the Byers' house when Joyce is trying to talk to Will.

I will upload photos of the final product when It's done.

Currently, the next step is to finish painting & hooking up the wires.
